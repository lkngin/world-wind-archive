# Community Effort to reverse-engineer and download the World Wind Project

- World Wind Project of NASA is shutting down
- Their software source code is available at https://github.com/NASAWorldWind/WorldWindServerKit
- This project tries to archive the data, and hopefully integrate it into the Internet Archive's servers, so
  that humanity can continue to benefit from public domain satellite imagery data.

- This repository contains scripts, details and info on how the world wind project is structured,
  as the original cache pack-serving website `worldwinddata.com` is now a parked domain and does
  not contain any cache packs anymore - and worldwind software is useless without its data.
